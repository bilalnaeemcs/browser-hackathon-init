# Minimal Browser

This is a bare-bones browser implementation I created for Andreas Kling's browser hackathon. Due to travel constraints during the hackathon, this version is intentionally minimal.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic browser structure, including:
- HTML parsing
- Simple rendering
- Basic CSS support

## Future Plans

I have several ideas to expand on this foundation:
- _TODOS_
<?
- Improved rendering engine
- Full CSS implementation
- JavaScript support
- Tab management
- Bookmarks and history
?>

This project serves as a starting point for a more robust browser implementation. I plan to revisit and enhance it when time allows.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Andreas Kling for inspiring this project through the browser hackathon.

Feel free to explore the code and check back for updates!
